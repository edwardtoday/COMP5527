	Abstract = {In this paper we deal with the high level management of data involved in Location-Based Services in order to accommodate corresponding queries. A series of techniques are employed on major components of an LBS, namely mobile users, application environment and selected services. First, a grouping technique generalizes the spatio-temporal data describing the mobile users' movement. The environment is represented under a combined spatial and content hierarchy according to the application at hand. Finally, in the service component, relational operators are formed to support relative spatio-temporal queries, while lifeline data types are constructed to extract and compare behavioral trend patterns among the formed user groups. We show how all proposed techniques communicate under a common database schema. Answers to characteristic queries demonstrate the applicability of this work.},

	Abstract = {Mobile computing technology is developing rapidly due to the advantages of information access through mobile devices and the need to retrieve information at remote locations. However, many obstacles within the discipline of wireless computing are yet to be resolved. One of the most significant of these issues is the speed of data retrieval, which directly affects the performance of mobile database applications. To remedy this problem, we propose here a revised methodology focusing on the management of mobile transactions. This paper investigates an extended semantic-based transaction management mechanism, and applies a model-based approach for developing a simulation model to evaluate the performance of our approach.},

	Abstract = {Mobile computing paradigm has emerged due to advances in wireless or cellular networking technology. This rapidly expanding technology poses many challenging research problems in the area of mobile database systems. The mobile users can access information independent of their physical location through wireless connections. However, accessing and manipulating information without restricting users to specific locations complicates data processing activities. There are computing constraints that make mobile database processing different from the wired distributed database computing. In this paper, we survey the fundamental research challenges particular to mobile database computing, review some of the proposed solutions and identify some of the upcoming research challenges. We discuss interesting research areas, which include mobile location data management, transaction processing and broadcast, cache management and replication and query processing. We highlight new upcoming research directions in mobile digital library, mobile data warehousing, mobile workflow and mobile web and e-commerce. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Recent development of hardware technologies such as communication medium which advances from wired to wireless has led to the emergence of mobile information systems. A major problem in such a mobile information system is how to locate mobile clients. This is named the location management issue. Two major costs are involved in managing a mobile client's location: the movement cost and the locating cost. Past methods can only minimize one of the two costs, but not both. The major contribution of this paper is to present methods that minimize both costs simultaneously. Our performance analysis proves that the proposed methods are superior to the past ones.},

	Abstract = {Mobile service systems offer users useful information ubiquitously via mobile devices. Based on changeable user movement behavior patterns (UMBPs), mobile service systems have the capability of effectively mining a special request from abundant data. In this paper, UMBPs are studied in terms of the problem of mining matching mobile access patterns based on joining the following four kinds of characteristics, U, L, T, and S, where U is the mobile user, L is the movement location, T is the dwell time in the timestamp, and S is the service request. By introducing standard graph-matching algorithms along with the primitives of a database management system, which comprises grouping, sorting, and joining, these joint operations are defined. Moreover, by mining the associated structure via maximum weight bipartite graph matching, a prediction mechanism, based on the model of UMBPs, is utilized to find strong relationships among U, L, T, and S. In addition, a PC-based experimental evaluation under various simulation conditions, using synthetically generated data, is introduced. Finally, performance studies are conducted to show that, in terms of execution efficiency and scalability, the proposed procedures produced excellent performance results.},

If the UPT database also manages location and status information of the MT on which the UPT user has registered incoming call delivery to the UPT user can be improved in a situation. Mobility management schemes for UPT users roaming in a mobile network are analyzed. The performance is evaluated in terms of signaling cost and the number of node accesses during an InCall registration.},

	Abstract = {Personal Communication Service (PCS) network is the integration of cellular Network and conventional wired network. To support user mobility, the locations of the mobile stations (MSs) should be constantly tracked using a database. The widespread deployment of PCS will lead to a tremendous increase in the number of updates and queries to the location database. The centralized, stand-alone Home Location Register (HLR) in GSM can be a potential bottleneck. In case of the location database failure, incoming calls may be lost. According to the analysis of the load in HLR, we suggest replicating the HLR in order to increase its capacity and reliability. In this paper we evaluate the effects of the number of replicas in terms of query response time, misrouting probability of incoming calls and average cost per query. Another issue incurred in the replicated databases is data consistency. A concurrency control protocol called preemptive Read-One-Write-All (PROWA) protocol is also proposed.},

	Abstract = {Continued advances in mobile networks and positioning technologies have created a strong market push for location-based applications. Examples include location-aware emergency response, location-based advertisement, and location-based entertainment. An important challenge in the wide deployment of location-based services (LBSs) is the privacy-aware management of location information, providing safeguards for location privacy of mobile clients against vulnerabilities for abuse. This paper describes a scalable architecture for protecting the location privacy from various privacy threats resulting from uncontrolled usage of LBSs. This architecture includes the development of a personalized location anonymization model and a suite of location perturbation algorithms. A unique characteristic of our location privacy architecture is the use of a flexible privacy personalization framework to support location k-anonymity for a wide range of mobile clients with context-sensitive privacy requirements. This framework enables each mobile client to specify the minimum level of anonymity that it desires and the maximum temporal and spatial tolerances that it is willing to accept when requesting k-anonymity-preserving LBSs. We devise an efficient message perturbation engine to implement the proposed location privacy framework. The prototype that we develop is designed to be run by the anonymity server on a trusted platform and performs location anonymization on LBS request messages of mobile clients such as identity removal and spatio-temporal cloaking of the location information. We study the effectiveness of our location cloaking algorithms under various conditions by using realistic location data that is synthetically generated from real road maps and traffic volume data. Our experiments show that the personalized location k-anonymity model, together with our location perturbation engine, can achieve high resilience to location privacy threats without introducing any significant performance penalty.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) established six mobile clinics to provide care for rural veterans. Each was operated by a parent VA Medical Center (VAMC). OBJECTIVE. TO describe the use of a cost-accounting system which does not provide costs at the service or patient level to determine the costs of the mobile clinics. RESEARCH DESIGN. Costs per visit were compared among the mobile clinics with the parent VAMCs and with simulated fixed-location clinics. Cost data came from VA's Centralized Accounting for Local Management (CALM) data. Utilization data came from VA's outpatient file. RESULTS. information was obtained from the VAMCs' fiscal services to reallocate costs among the CALM subaccounts to generate cost data that was comparable among the mobile clinics. Costs per visit for the mobile clinics were twice as high as those of the parent VAMCs. Costs per visit would be lower at fixed-location clinics unless the volume were substantially less than that provided by the mobile clinics. CONCLUSION. Differences between cost allocations for accounting purposes and research are likely to necessitate adjusting cost accounting data for research purposes. Fortunately, information from the accountants or primary data can lead to a cost database which is appropriate for research evaluations. In the mobile clinics study, the analysis of cost accounting data led to the conclusion that mobile clinics were not a cost-effective way in which to provide care to rural veterans.},

The proposed scheme is able to give satisfactory answer of queries related to three different types of data, namely query involving proximity of a desired object, query for private data and query for broadcast/public type data. All location dependent data are distributed among different components of mobile cellular network in such a way that message exchange among themselves are much less as well as query raised by mobile unit can be answered satisfactorily. The suitable file organisation to support the database is also proposed here. Exhaustive simulation work is done to study the performance of the system for getting satisfactory answer of the query by varying different parameters like rate of query arrival, time etc.},

	Abstract = {Future networks will require a functionality that supports timely access to relevant data, voice and image information irrespective of the users' location and access to fixed facilities. Required is the capability to support dynamic decision-making among distributed command, control, communications, computing and intelligence (C4I) users and assets. Of particular importance is the emerging need for distributed computing, remote database access, collaborative multimedia planning, and tele-medicine to mobile subscribers. The tempo of rapid force projection demands an ability to make and communicate decisions quickly, to execute operations that deny the opposition a pause, and to exploit new opportunities. These paradigms will support the capability to transition from highly stable, fixed assets to highly dynamic missions where network connectivity approaches a state of chaos. This network of the future requires flexibility, capacity and resiliency currently not available to the mobile subscriber. This paper summarizes results of our research on mobile mesh network (mmNET) system requirements necessary to support nomadic users engaged in distributed computing and information distribution. Our model of the mmNET consists of a set of low-power, radio frequency (RF) transceivers that move relative to each other across a geographical area subject to RF propagation impairments. The low power defines a radio coverage area that limits the number of neighbors but optimizes the throughput per unit area. The combination of low power and propagation environment, however, produces a network characterized by stochastic link failures. The rapidity of these failures and the perturbations to the network topology places severe constraints on network management policies. We model the progression of user services from a highly reliable, static network environment to one characterized by chaotic connectivity. The basic premise of this view of a mmNET is that host mobility may place the subscriber in a situation that prevents a priori knowledge of any predetermined location. The impact of adaptive (e.g., `'smart'') antennas on system capabilities is discussed. Meeting subscriber requirement across this diverse range of scenarios demands a robust, flexible information transport approach to deliver all required information.},

	Abstract = {In ubiquitous computing we need to know the present in order to interact properly with nearby smart elements. When we are moving outdoors, mobile devices take a very important role because they provide us with a link between the world outside and ourselves through means of intelligent interfaces. There are a lot of situations in which it would be very useful to know or foresee the future context, i.e. as a geographic environment, where we could find ourselves in a near future, and at the same time being able to use that information from our devices. Therefore we must preview this location with enough precision and time and be able to use this information from our mobile device. In our ``OnTheWay'' system, we used GPS technology and databases made of past paths taken by a person, in order to predict the next location, once we had begun a new course, comparing the new one with those ones stored. The results were amazing: from the data collected about paths travelled during a month and five days, we got the actual destination in 98% of cases, when we have only made a 30,35% of the total path. Therefore, including statistic and semantic information will allow us to upgrade our results, due to the sedentary human behaviour, the small number of frequently visited locations and the fact that the paths used to arrive to these locations are usually the same.},

	Abstract = {As users become more dependent on the ability to access information on demand at any location, the span of access of data repositories will have to grow. The increasing social acceptance of the home or any other location as a place of work is a further impetus to the development of mechanisms for mobile information access. These considerations imply that data from shared file systems, relational databases, object-oriented databases, and other repositories must be accessible to programs running on mobile computers. For example, a technician servicing a jet engine on a parked aircraft needs access to engineering details of that model of engine as well as past repair records of that specific engine. Similarly, a businessman who is continuing his work on the train home from Manhattan needs access to his business records. Yet another example involves emergency medical response to a case of poisoning: the responding personnel will need rapid access to medical databases describing poison symptoms and antidotes, as well as access to the specific patient's medical records to determine drug sensitivity. This article is a status report on the work being done toward meeting such challenges. It begins by describing a scenario that offers a tantalizing glimpse of the power of mobile information access. The major obstacles on the path toward this vision are then examined. It also includes a summary of research on overcoming these obstacles in the context of the Coda and Odyssey systems},

	Abstract = {This paper traces the history of location-based service (LBS) standards that arose from North American requirements in the work on GSM standards in the late 1990s. It also describes how interest in GSM/UMTS outside Europe led to the creation of the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for developing UMTS standards (which include standards for the 3G mobile Internet). In addition, the paper covers the role of other standards bodies and interest groups involved in the creation of LBS standards such as the new Open Mobile Alliance.Different location methods for detecting the position of mobiles are described and a summary of the current work in 3GPP on LBS-based services and architecture for UMTS is given. The paper also covers work on wireless access protocols in the old WAP Forum.},

	Abstract = {The penetration of mobile wireless technologies has resulted in larger usage of wireless data services in the recent past. Several wireless applications are deployed by service providers, to attract and retain their clients, using wireless Internet technologies. New and innovative applications like ringtone/wallpaper downloading, MMS-messaging, videoclip delivery and reservation enquiries are some of the popular services offered by the service providers today. The knowledge of mobile user's location by the service provider can enhance the class of services and applications that can be offered to the mobile user. These class of applications and services, termed "location based services", are becoming popular across all mobile networks like GSM and CDMA. This paper presents a brief survey of location based services, the technologies deployed to track the mobile user's location, the accuracy and reliability associated with such measurements, and the network infrastructure elements deployed by the wireless network operators to enable these kinds of services. A brief description of all the protocols and interfaces covering the interaction between device, gateway and application layers, are presented. The aspects related to billing of value added services using the location information and emerging architectures for incorporating this "location based charging" model are introduced. The paper also presents some popular location based services deployed on wireless across the world.},

	Abstract = {Transaction support is crucial in mobile data management. Specific characteristics of mobile environments ( e. g. variable bandwidth, disconnections, limited resources on mobile hosts) make traditional transaction management techniques no longer appropriate. Several models for mobile transactions have been proposed but it is difficult to have an overview of all of them. This paper analyzes and compares several contributions to mobile transactions. The analysis distinguishes two groups of models. The first group includes proposals where transactions are completely or partially executed on mobile hosts. In this group we focus on ACID properties support. The second group considers transactions requested by mobile hosts and executed on the wired network. In this case, ACID properties are not compromised and focus is on supporting mobile host movements during transaction execution. Discussions pointing out limitations, interesting solutions and research perspectives complete this paper.},

@article{Haas:1999vr,
	Abstract = {A distributed mobility-management scheme using a class of uniform quorum systems (UQS) is proposed for nd hoc networks. In the proposed scheme, location databases are stored in the network nodes themselves, which form a self-organizing virtual backbone within the flat network structure. The databases are dynamically organized into quorums, every two of which intersect at a constant number of databases. Upon location update or call arrival, a mobile's location information is written to or read from all the databases of a quorum, chosen in a nondeterministic manner. Compared with a conventional scheme [such as the use of home location register (HLR)] with fixed associations, this scheme is more suitable for ad hoc networks, where the connectivity of the nodes with the rest of the network can be intermittent and sporadic and the databases are relatively unstable. We introduce UQS, where the size of the quorum intersection is a design parameter that can be tuned to adapt to the traffic and mobility patterns of the network nodes. We propose the construction of UQS through the balanced incomplete block designs. The average cost, due to call loss and location updates using such systems, is analyzed in the presence of database disconnections. Based on the average cost, we investigate the tradeoff between the system reliability and the cost of location updates in the UQS scheme. The problem of optimizing the quorum size under different network traffic and mobility patterns Is treated numerically. A dynamic and distributed HLR scheme, as a limiting case of the UQS, is also analyzed and shown to be suboptimal in general. It is also shown that partitioning of the network is sometimes necessary to reduce the cost of mobility management.},

	Abstract = {With the proliferation of mobile computing technologies, location based services have been identified as one of the most promising target application. We classify mobile information service domains based on feature characteristics of the information sources and different patterns of mobile information access. By carefully examining the service requirements, we identify the dynamic data management problem that must be addressed for effective location based services in mobile environments. We then devise a general architecture and cost model for servicing both location independent and location dependent data. Based on the architecture and cost model, we propose a set of dynamic data management strategies that employs judicious caching, proactive server pushing and neighborhood replication to reduce service cost and improve response time under changing user mobility and access patterns. Detail behavior analysis helps us in precisely capturing when and how to apply these strategies. Simulation results suggest that different strategies are effective for different types of data in response to different patterns of movement and information access.},

	Abstract = {In traditional ways of managing data, the relationship between the data and the geographical location of the organization it represents, is usually ignored. In wireless computing this property of ``location transparency'' is in fact often replaced by a ``location dependency'' property. Furthermore, the mode of issuing queries (the geographical location where the queries originate, the way they are issued, etc.) on such data determines the outcome. Location dependent data is data whose value depends on its location. The objective of the paper is to introduce this topic and spawn further related research},

	Abstract = {Mobile computing paradigm has emerged due to advances in wireless or cellular networking technology. This rapidly expanding technology poses many challenging research problems in the area of mobile database systems. The mobile users can access information independent of their physical location through wireless connections. However, accessing and manipulating information without restricting users to specific locations complicates data processing activities. There are computing constraints that make mobile database processing different from the wired distributed database computing. In this paper, we survey the fundamental research challenges particular to mobile database computing, review some of the proposed solutions and identify some of the upcoming research challenges. We discuss interesting research areas, which include mobile location data management, transaction processing and broadcast, cache management and replication and query processing. We highlight new upcoming research directions in mobile digital library, mobile data warehousing, mobile workflow and mobile web and e-commerce. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Location-based services (LBS) depends on data gathered from mobile and ubiquitous devices and use to provide services like getting the appropriate location of a mobile user presented in physical and logical maps. The main operations of location management in LBS are updating and searching or paging. Some studies to improve these were presented by using optimal sequential paging and location area schemes. Different LBS means variety of methods on accessing data that leads to complexity of providing services. In this paper, we use an approach of hierarchical structured agents for the method of locating a mobile object in a location-based service. This study focuses on location management by using agents. Agents were used for accessing the distributed data-bases on LBS. It also introduces a hierarchical searching method that uses a nearest neighbor technique for fast searching. The result of using the technique shows an improved searching method in the location management.},

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of indexing a set of objects moving in d-dimensional spaces along linear trajectories. A simple external-memory indexing scheme is proposed to efficiently answer general range queries. The following are examples of the queries that can be answered by the proposed method: report all moving objects that will ( i) pass between two given points within a specified time interval; ( ii) become within a given distance from some or all of a given set of other moving objects. Our scheme is based on mapping the objects to a dual space, where queries about moving objects are transformed into polyhedral queries concerning their speeds and initial locations. We then present a simple method for answering such polyhedral queries, based on partitioning the space into disjoint regions and using a B+-tree to index the points in each region. By appropriately selecting the boundaries of each region, we guarantee an average search time that matches a known lower bound for the problem. Specifically, for a fixed d, if the coordinates of a given set of N points are statistically independent, the proposed technique answers polyhedral queries, on the average, in O(( N/B)(1-1/d) \{\&}BULL; ( log(B) N)(1/d) + K/B) I/ O's using O(N/B) space, where B is the block size, and K is the number of reported points. Our approach is novel in that, while it provides a theoretical upper bound on the average query time, it avoids the use of complicated data structures, making it an effective candidate for practical applications. The proposed index is also dynamic in the sense that it allows object insertion and deletion in an amortized update cost of logB( N) I/ O's. Experimental results are presented to show the superiority of the proposed index over other methods based on R-trees.},

	Abstract = {In a personal communications service (PCS) network, mobility databases called visitor location registers (VLRs) are utilized to temporarily store the subscription data and the location information for the roaming users. Because of user mobility, it is possible that the VLR is full when a mobile user arrives. Under such a circumstance, the incoming user has no VLR record and thus cannot receive PCS services. This issue is called VLR overflow. To resolve the VLR overflow problem, a VLR record can be selected for replacement when the VLR is full and then the reclaimed storage is used to hold the record of the requesting user. This paper considers the most idle replacement policy to provide services to mobile users without VLR records. In this policy, the record with the longest idle time is selected for replacement. We propose an analytic model to investigate the performance of this replacement policy. The analytic results are validated against simulation experiments. The results indicate that our approach effectively resolves the VLR overflow problem.},

	Abstract = {The radical evolution of stationary databases to wireless databases has created several novel properties, including mobility in particular. This property has created a new query operation namely location-dependent query. In location-dependent query, the location of the object becomes the parameter of the query, and since the object continuously moves from one place to another, it requires a complex mechanism to monitor the object location as well as ensure a valid query result. Location-dependent information services will soon become common, and providing efficient and effective mobile query services will be critical. However, due to inherent constraints, such as low bandwidth, short-life battery, limited storage space, and frequent disconnection, information services to mobile clients have been much restricted. in this paper, we present a state-of-the-art in data management for location-dependent query processing. We discuss location-dependent query processing techniques, which are focusing on server strategies, mobile client strategies, and on-air strategies. We further classify each strategy into dynamic and static location-dependent data.},

	Abstract = {Previous research in the area of mobile transactions has mainly concentrated in developing schemes for processing conventional transactions, location management, and data broadcast. No one has examined how such mobility issues as location dependent data (LDD) impact the actual definition of a transaction in the mobile computing environment. There is a distinct lack of work related to how LDD impacts consistency and transactions. The objective of this paper is to fill this void and identify the future requirements of complete ubiquitous data processing systems. First we examine the effect of mobility on transaction processing and commitment, specifically examining the impact of location dependent data. Next we discuss and analyze a number of application and system level issues and present our solutions for some of the problems. in particular we develop a transaction model called ``Mobilaction'' for the mobile database systems, propose new commitment protocols for Mobilactions and present a formal treatment of consistency in the presence of LDD. Our work presented opens up a new direction in mobile computing data processing research.},

	Abstract = {In the era in which activities performed by mobile users are tracked through various sensing mechanisms, the movement data collected through these sensors is submitted into a data mining algorithm in order to determine the movement pattern. The movement pattern refers to the pattern that mobile users generally take to move from one base location to another base location through multiple intermediate locations. This paper provides a proposal and case study on how the movement pattern can be extracted from mobile users through transforming the user movement database to the location movement database and subsequently transferred to all algorithm Apriori-like movement pattern (AMP) and movement tree (M-tree). The result is a list of sequences in which mobile users frequently go through that which satisfies min-support and min-confidence. The result of this movement pattern mining exercise opens lip a new future for the prediction of the movement for the individual mobile user.},

	Abstract = {IETF proposed Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) to support host mobility and mobility management involves signaling costs at various mobility entities of the network. Widespread use of IP-enabled mobile devices have resulted in increase in number of mobile users and the signaling cost on underlying mobility entities have increased significantly, which will result in their performance degradation. However, there has been no comprehensive cost analysis of mobility protocol entities that considers all possible costs. In this paper, we have developed analytical models to estimate total costs of key mobility management entities of HMIPv6. We have presented numerical results to demonstrate the impact of network size, mobility rate, traffic rate and data volume on these costs and the percentage overhead on the mobility entities. Our results show that a significant amount of resources are required by the mobility entities for transmission, processing of various signaling messages, as well as searching location database. Our cost analysis will thus be helpful for military applications in estimating actual resource requirements for on-board IP-enabled devices in military vans, tanks, helicopters that require mobility management especially while in operation.},

	Abstract = {The main concept of location based services enterprise mobility (LBS-EM) is to grab the information of location based objects, which are specified such as restaurant, hospitals, IT companies etc, and the same to view on the mobile device. LBS works similar to the yellow pages where you have to search for the specified object. To avail a beneficial mobile access to the data through the cell you can definitely make use of the component. It is a J2ME enabled ESRI component, on request gives information regarding the specified address or the stored address, which will be in the form of image, not only the specified address, but also the phone number and related information. In this paper, we are using ARC web services ESRI component, which is responsible for the data management of all information and the security of data. This component can be easily installable in handheld devices and make use of it, whenever you need the actual data. A new architecture of LBS with ARC Web Services is proposed.},

	Abstract = {With the advancement of technologies in wireless communication and computer down-sizing, it becomes possible to access a global network using handy terminals which are equipped with wireless communication facilities. In such a mobile computing environment, data management is one of the primary objectives of effective computer uses. However, since conventional distributed data management technologies assume that servers and clients are fixed at certain locations in a network, they do not provide any tools to construct advanced applications which make full use of dynamically changing information in such an environment. In this paper, in order to incorporate data distributed over mobile computing environment, we propose a dynamic data integration mechanism called MobiView which is an enhanced view mechanism of a conventional database system. In MobiView, we introduce four methods for database indication without using conventional host name or its local name: host-specified, cell-specified, location-dependent, and MobiView-oriented, through which we discuss how to handle both mobile database servers and mobile database clients.},

We introduce the location model employed by CAMEL, the component architecture and key components of CAMLE, including a Database component, Location Listener, Query Engine, Location Filter, Trigger Handier and Data Server. The component-based architecture facilitates easy deployment of CAMEL for meeting different service model, such as push service, moving object monitor and moving object data warehousing.
